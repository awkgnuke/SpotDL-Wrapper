# SpotDL-Wrapper

Hello! 
This is a spotdl Wrapper for mac, I used Applescript and Platypus (https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) to make it. Enjoy :)
You can download the latest version from releases - https://github.com/awkgnuke/SpotDL-Wrapper/releases/tag/Latest

You need:


- Homebrew,
- Python 3 (Needs to have a binary @ /usr/local/bin/python3) a version that supports Spotdl,
- pip (Should be included with your python installation),
- spotdl and its dependencies - installed through pip

To Do:
  - Make music auto-sorted into folders in Artist/Album/Music format
  - make pip update and make spotdl update whenever the app is launched/whenever the computer is turned on
Fix Any Bugs:
  - OG App not quitting when helper appears
  - The Helper not being brought to the front on launch

## Acknowledgements
- Platypus
- AppleScript
- The Makers of spotdl for an incredible utility!
