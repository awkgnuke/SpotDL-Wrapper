# SpotDL-Wrapper

Hello! 
This is a spotdl Wrapper for mac, I used Applescript and Platypus (https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) to make it. Enjoy :)
You need:
Homebrew,
Python 3 (Needs to have a binary @ /usr/local/bin/python3) a version that supports Spotdl,
pip (Should be included with your python installation),
spotdl and its dependencies - installed through pip
